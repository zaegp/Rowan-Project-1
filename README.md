# STYLiSH
An e-commerce application that provides a seamless customer experience, from sign-up and product browsing to item search and completing the checkout process.
- Designed and implemented user interfaces using **Storyboard** to efficiently manage and visualize the app's layout and flow.
- Implemented **Core Data** to store cart items locally, ensuring they persist across sessions so users can easily resume their shopping experience when they return.
- Integrated with third-party APIs (**Facebook Login** and **TapPay**), allowing users to quickly sign up and complete the checkout process efficiently.
